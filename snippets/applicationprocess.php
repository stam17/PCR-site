	<i>Purrfect Cat Rescue is based in Northern California. Our adoption events are held in Fremont, Newark, and Union City where the majority of our adopters live; but we are happy to work with anyone in the Bay Area. If you live outside the Bay Area and are interested in finding adoptable pets, please consult

<h3>Adoption Process</h3>

<p>We have done our best to make adopting through Purrfect Cat Rescue a simple and rewarding experience. All cats and kittens are fostered in caring homes so they are ready to move into yours.</p>

Here is the medical care we provide them:
<li>Spay/neuter</li>
<li>Two 3-in-1 (FVRCP) vaccinations</li>
<li>Preventative treatment for fleas with Bravecto or Revolution (and Drontal for worms if deemed necessary)</li>
<br>
<p>Available cats and kittens can be seen weekly at our adoption fairs. You will need to fill out an adoption application (download available at bottom of this page), and, upon approval, agree to the terms of the Purrfect Cat adoption contract.  The current adoption fee is $110 and is a fully tax deductible donation that ensures our work continues. </p>

<h3>Adoption Terms</h3>
​
The terms are fairly simple, we require the following assurances:
<ul>
	<li>That the entire family is in agreement about bringing a pet into their home, and that it will be an indoor only (unless otherwise discussed with us) family pet.</li>

	<li>That the adoptive family will not surgically declaw their new cat. While fairly common thirty years ago, there is a great deal of new evidence that declawing can be both physically and emotionally harmful to cats over time.</li>

	<li>That the adoptive family is allowed to have pets where they currently live. If you are a renter, a letter from your landlord or apartment manager simplifies the process, but is not required as we can contact them ourselves if necessary.</li>

	<li>That potential adopters have not misrepresented themselves, their family, current and/or previous pets, or dwelling in an effort to facilitate the adoption process. We reserve the right to take a cat back into our care should we find this to be the case.</li>
</ul>
