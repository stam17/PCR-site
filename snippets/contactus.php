<h3>Past adopters: </h3>

<p>If you are a past adopter and have questions about the cat you adopted, refer to the adoption contract for the foster home name and contact information, located just below the adoptive cat information.</p>

<p>If you have questions on what medical care has been provided to your cat: All the cats in our care are spayed and neutered, receive two FVRCP vaccinations, are treated with Bravecto or Revolution for fleas, and with Drontal for worms if it is deemed necessary. NO CATS have been vaccinated for FeLV or Rabies unless a foster has specifically told you otherwise. DO NOT contact us asking for proof of rabies or FeLV vaccinations.</p>
