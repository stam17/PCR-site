<h1>Fostering</h1>

<p>There is no greater need for our organization than families willing to open their homes to cats and kittens while they await adoption.  Fostering is a rewarding and sometimes challenging experience; and the backbone of our adoption program. Purrfect Cat provides foster homes with all the supplies they need—food, litter, kitten milk (for bottle babies) and medical care. You provide a safe, caring home, and assure that the cats get to any necessary veterinary appointments and our weekend adoption events. It is essential that the foster home is able to provide the necessary transportation and time. </p>

<p>Fostering is, of course, a responsibility—and one worth sharing with children in most age groups—but much of it is also personally rewarding, educational, and completely worth the time and effort you put into it.</p>

<p>We do our best to work with fosters so they are comfortable with the age and number of cats they are caring for, and we can usually provide temporary cat sitting in another foster home in the case of vacation or a personal emergency. We also provide fosters with lots of advice and suggestions so they will never feel they are on their own.</p>
