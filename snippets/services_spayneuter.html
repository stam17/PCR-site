		<h1>Low-Cost Vouchers</h1>

		<p>In our view, no companion cat should remain unaltered, and the best bet to seeing that a reality is to remove the financial obstacle for the pet owner.  To that end, Purrfect Cat Rescue has partnered with local veterinarians to offer the public low-cost spay and neuter vouchers.</p>  

		There are two types of vouchers:
		<ol>
			<li>Tame ($50): intended for a social, family pet</li>
			<li>Feral ($30): intended for non-social cats stray and neighborhood cats</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Non-tame cats should be taken to the vet appointment in a humane trap (see <a href="#traps">below</a>).  Additionally, they will be ear-tipped during sedation so they can be easily identified in future as a sterile cat.</p>

		<p>We sell the vouchers at our weekend adoption events for cash or check—no credit/debit cards.  The voucher cost covers the spay/neuter. At the the time of the vet appointment there is no additional cost unless you opt for vaccinations or other medical care.  (Our vet in Union City offers low-cost vaccinations on specific days of the week should you want to vaccinate the cats you are spaying.)</p>
		 

		The following vets honor our vouchers:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="irvingtonpethospital.com">Irvington Pet Hospital</a>, Fremont
			</li>
