	<h1>Stray & Found Kittens</h1>

	<h3>What Not To Do</h3>
		<p>People who discover kittens in their yards or a public space generally go into panic mode and act before thinking it through.  And while very young kittens do need almost constant care, taking a few minutes to analyze the situation is not going to be the difference between life in death (except in extreme cases, and then all bets are off).</p>

		<p>Whatever you do, please do not leave found animals unattended at pet supply stores, veterinary offices, etc. There is no guarantee that they will be found in time to help them. And should you take found animals into a pet supply store or veterinary office seeking advice, do not use emotional blackmail to force help out of them. This is all too common, people threatening to toss them in the trash if someone else does not take them. If you are in a situation where you have no other choice but to surrender a found animal, call a 24-hour veterinary clinic and explain your situation to them. </p>

	<h3>What to Do</h3>
	<p><i>There are variables in each specific case that will decide how to proceed, but here a few guidelines for common cases.</i></p>
	<p><b>First, determine the age of kittens using the infographic <a href="http://www.kittenlady.org/age">here</a>.</b></p>

	<span class="case">Case 1: </span>
	<span> The kittens are in a relatively safe location and being cared for by their mother: <span>
	<p class="case-cap">You should not immediately remove them. Nursing rather than bottle feeding provides the best start for kittens, so it is preferable (and more economical) to provide food and water to the mother cat and let her keep the kittens healthy. If she seems comfortable with you and does not show signs of moving the kittens, there is no reason to do anything until the kittens are 3 to 4 weeks old and starting to move around and explore. If, on the other hand, she begins to move them (not just to another part of the yard, but out completely) then you might need to collect them.</p>

	<span class="case">Case 2: </span>
	<span> The kittens you've found are at least 4 weeks old and walking around:</span>
	<p class="case-cap">You want to get them soon, whether the mother is around or not. This is the ideal age to bring kittens into your home. They are old enough to eat kitten food (with a little supplemental KMR to begin with) but still young enough to be socialized for adoption. The mother needs to be spayed using one of the local low-cost spay and neuter programs to assure that this is her last litter. If she is not social, we can advise you on how to go about trapping her for spaying.</p>

	<span class="case">Case 3: </span>
	<span> The kittens are very young and there is no sign of the mother: <span>
	<p class="case-cap">Move away a distance and allow her an hour to show up as she may just be looking for food, then you probably should take the kittens in. You will need to contain them in a pet carrier, box, laundry basket, etc. with a heating pad and bottle feed them kitten replacement milk (cow milk should only be used short-term in an emergency, and goat milk, if you can find it, is preferable).</p>


	<p>Whatever the situation, contact us or one of the other groups listed in our resources (we are working to update and expand them currently) with all the pertinent information. Remember that spring and summer are "kitten season" and the smaller local organizations are overwhelmed with requests so help might not be immediate. It can take days or even weeks to find foster homes so we encourage people to try to make an effort to care for them, if only short-term.</p>

	<p>Because of this lack of foster homes, we have created a secondary adoption program called the Public Assist Program in which members of the public foster the cats they have found, and we act as a facilitator for vaccinations, low-cost spay/neuter, and a place to show the cats for eventual adoption.
