<h1>Volunteering</h1>

<p>Despite being a small organization, our core membership and foster homes generally provide us with enough people to run our weekly adoption events. Because of this we don't require in-store volunteers on a regular basis. We do, however, need people who can transport animals to and from adoption events when a foster home is unavailable, as well as short-term foster homes in the case of a volunteer being sick or on vacation.  If you cannot commit to being a full-time volunteer, a vacation or emergency alternate might be right for you. Contact us for more information.</p>

â€‹<p>Community Service: We cannot accommodate people seeking to fulfill a community service requirement at this time.</p>
