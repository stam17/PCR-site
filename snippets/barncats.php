<h1>Barn Cats</h1>

	    <p>At any given time, a member or two of Purrfect Cat Rescue have cats in their homes that are not truly feral but not-quite social enough to be family pets. These cats--usually taken in as kittens we felt had a good chance at socialization--create a difficult and painful situation for us. Unless they came from a managed feral colony we cannot in good conscience simply return them outdoors, and we do not take cats to the shelter, turning our dilemma into a problem for someone else to solve.  Nor do we euthanize otherwise healthy cats.</p>
		<p>The cats, inevitably, live their life out in the home or yard of one of our volunteers, not really a family pet, but a life-long responsibility all the same.  One of the better solutions to this issue is placing the cats in stables, orchards, and nurseries where they can help to control the vermin population, and live on their own terms, but with human supervision/protection. It's not a simple matter of placing a cat in a new location to fend for itself. It is, in fact, a process that requires time and commitment both from those placing the cat and those taking the cat.</p>
		<p>There needs to an acclimation period to assure the cat, being unfamiliar with its new home, doesn't simply run off; and there must be a secure building of some kind that provides the cat shelter from both inclimate weather and predators. There is always the chance that a barn cat might be killed by a predator, but the risk is drastically reduced when the correct protocol is followed.</p>
