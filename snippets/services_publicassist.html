	​<h1>Public Assist Adoption Program</h1>

	<p>Often, members of the public come to us with cats and kittens they have found, hoping we can help to place them in homes. While we would like to take in all the cats/kittens in need, we are a small rescue with both limited reach and foster homes. It's important that the number of cats we bring into the program doesn’t overwhelm our foster homes and is in keeping with the current local rate of animal adoptions.</p>


	<h3>TERMS</h3>
	<i>PLEASE READ FULLY:</i> 
	<p>Until the downloadable form below has been completed and approved by a PCR member, and the cat(s) are deemed appropriate for socialization and adoption, PCR has not committed to helping you. We receive more requests than we can ever commit to, so acting decisively on your part could be the difference in receiving assistance.</p>

	<p>We ask for a <b>$50</b> donation per kitten you bring into the Public Assist Program. This money will be used towards spaying/neutering, vaccinations, flea control and deworming.  It also serves to show a commitment on the part of the foster home since we will, if you wish, reimburse you <b>$35</b> of your donation upon the adoption of each cat. (Depending on the financial need of participants, we may be able to reduce this donation, but bear in mind we are a small non-profit that relies entirely on public donations for its existence.)</p>

	<p>The cats remain in your home until they are adopted. You socialize the cats and transport them to and from adoption events. Potential adopters must complete an application and speak with us as we facilitate the adoption process.  We encourage participants to be part of that process, talking with those interested in your cat to be sure they are the right match. Everyone wants a "perfect" home for the cats, but we must have realistic expectations: an adopter who provides a safe, nurturing environment and whose lifestyle/household is compatible with the cat's needs is all we can really ask. When you partner with us, you not only make use of our low-cost spay resources and adoption locations but our years of experience working with the public to assure each cat a good home.  We will be working as partners and there needs to be mutual trust.</p>


	<p>It may take weeks or even months for all your cats to find homes so doing your part is crucial: bring them to adoption events regularly and allow daily time for play and socialization.  When a cat is adopted, we allow for a 30-day acclimation period to be sure the cat and adoptive home are compatible; if an adoption does not work out, the cat will be returned to your care.</p>


	<h3>Owner Assist</h3> 
	<p>This is a specific part of this program which differs only in that the cats being placed for adoption actually belong to the individuals seeking our help. The terms and conditions outlined above are entirely the same, and we also require veterinary proof of spay/neuter and vaccinations. </p>
	 
	<h3>Owner Surrender</h3>
	<p>Animals in need of immediate re-homing cannot be given to and fostered by Purrfect Cat Rescue. We must refer people in this situation to the East Bay SPCA and Humane Society Silicon Valley, both of which have Owner Surrender programs and do their best to accommodate people in need of re-homing companion animals. Be aware that there is generally a fee to use these services.</p>
