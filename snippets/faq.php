    <h2 id="sec1">What is Purrfect Cat Rescue?</h2>
    <p>
    Purrfect Cat Rescue is an all-volunteer non-profit (EIN #38-3729165). Our main focus is the adoption of home-fostered (we do not have a shelter or facility) cats & kittens and providing low-cost spay & neuter to the public. â€‹We currently have only 8 foster homes to care for all the cats and kittens in our program. We do not have any association with Tri-City Animal Services, any local shelters, nor do we receive local, state or national funding. We are a small, private organization with limited scope, serving Fremont, Newark & Union City.

    <h2 id="sec2">Can PCR take my cats/kittens?</h2>
    <p>
      We currently have only 8 foster homes to care for all the cats and kittens in our program. This greatly limits the cats we ourselves can care for. Given the number of requests of assistance we receive (particularly during kitten season), we are only able to meet a small part of that need. 

      If we are able to offer assistance, please respond right away, as there will always be someone else waiting for that offer of help. This rule applies to any of the other organizations we might refer you to; your request of aid is just one of the many they receive so follow up quickly when they offer their support.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sec3">What is the Public Assist Program?</h2>
    <p>
      Because of our limited capaity, we make every effort to assist members of the public in adopting out the cats/kittens they have found when they themselves are willing/able to foster the cats in their own homes. Our Public Assist program is outlined <a href="snippets\services_publicassist.html">here</a>

    <h2 id="sec4">>Does PCR provide medical care for strays/ferals?</h2>
    <p>
    Purrfect Cat Rescue (or any other rescue we are aware of) cannot provide medical care, urgent or otherwise, for strays and ferals. Call local vets to see if they participate in a "concerned citizen" program for found cats and dogs.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="sec5">>Does PCR work with feral cats?</h2>
    <p>Purrfect Cat Rescue is not a feral cat organization. Our volunteers cannot trap animals or relocate feral cats. For those interested in beginning a trap/neuter project, we can provide access to low-cost spay and neuter, information on trapping, and resources for the services we ourselves cannot offer the public <a href="snippets\services_spayneuter.html">(more here)</a>.</p>
